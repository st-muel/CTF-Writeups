# Treasure

```
My friend Beale passed me this chunk of text, with the following message:

14-13-58-60-13-190-187-41-38-13-107-2-70-4-9-107-127-38-37-49-60-60-49-9-59-35

He told me that this message will lead me to find a treasure.
```

Reading the challenge name and description, it seems that we're supposed to find a treasure. The description seems to be of little use for now, so let's move on to the included file! The file seems to be a .docx file, and running `file` on it seems to confirm it.
